Problem Statement

By the advancement in modern era we have a handsome amount of data, but the data is often not in a good quality or some fine tuning is required to it.  If we refer to image data, the images are often in low resolution and some major details are missing in the image. To counter this problem there is a technique called Image Super Resolution. 

Work done in 

FYP-II:

We studied basic concepts of deep learning via help of convolutional neural network and Generative Adversarial networks.

We implemented two research papers regarding image super resolution.

The first one was 

“Photo-realistic 

single image super-resolution using a generative adversarial network

.”

And the second one is “

A 

fully progressive approach to single-image 

super-resolution.”

Work to do 

for FYP-II:

In our FYP-II we are trying to propose a new Image super resolution method based on 

previous research

. 

We 

are proposing two methods for image super resolution

.

The first approach is to first super resolve the image and then apply enhancement technique 

to the 

image

.

The second approach is that we will split the image in blocks (Multiple of 2) and then 

super resolve 

each block for better feature extraction

.

We will also make a web portal to showcase our previous implementation and our proposed methods. 

Work done from FYP-1 till mid-evaluation date:

We have thought of two techniques to enhance image super resolution.

Prototyped the above mentioned techniques.
