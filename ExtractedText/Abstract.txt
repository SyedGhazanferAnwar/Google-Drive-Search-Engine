Project Objective: To study “Single Image Super Resolution” in depth and propose an enhanced version.

Practical Application: The Image Super Resolution can be used in various fields to gain the missing artifacts in the images. 

Technologies: Python, Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Flask, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio/Code-Server, Linux, Azure.

Abstract:

By the advancement in modern era we have a handsome amount of data, but the data is often not in a good quality or some fine tuning is required to it.  If we refer to image data, the images are often in low resolution and some major details are missing in the image. To counter this problem there is a technique called Image Super Resolution. Enhancing the quality of a lower resolution image by adding missing pixels and texture details by increasing its dimensions (upscaling) is known as Image Super Resolution (ISR). ISR has been an area of interest for a past decade but techniques used like bicubic interpolation were not giving satisfactory results so new methods have been proposed which includes usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Network and Residual Networks to achieve Image Super Resolution. We have implemented two research papers a fully progressive approach to single-image super-resolution and Photo-realistic single image super-resolution using a generative adversarial network.
